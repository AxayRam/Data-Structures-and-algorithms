## 🧠 Data Structures for Embedded Engineers

Data structures are essential for:

- RTOS queues
- Circular buffers
- ISR-safe communication
- Custom schedulers
- Memory managers

### Key Structures Implemented in C:

- 📁 Arrays & Structs → sensor tables, device mappings  
- 🔗 Linked List → task queues, memory pool handling  
- 📚 Stack → call depth, parsers, buffer rollback  
- 📤 Queue → message passing, producer-consumer buffers  
- 🔁 Circular Buffer → UART RX/TX ring buffers  
- 🌳 Tree (basic) → device tree understanding (Linux)
